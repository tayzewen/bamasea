                    Bama’s buyers follow the U.S. fleet fishing from Texas to North Carolina, off-loading domestic shrimp at facilities throughout the Gulf of Mexico. Bama has also established relationships and shrimp programs with suppliers from around the globe with imports from Ecuador, Peru, India & Indonesia. Working with SGS and BRC audited plants in those countries, and with our own on-site inspectors, we continue to expand our shrimp purchasing in South America. Our long time relationships throughout Asia afford us the ability to be a true “Global Sourcing” company.

Bama has our own QC staff at each facility during production. The product is then shipped to our St. Petersburg plant where it undergoes an exacting quality check before being approved for sale. With our ability to grade, pack, peel, bread, cook, par fry and IQF shrimp we can assure that we have the product you need in the form and pack you need on a year round basis. We have the ability to pack in our own brands or our customer’s private label.
